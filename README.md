# NBA_Performance_Predictor
Description:
This repository hosts a comprehensive data science project focused on predicting the future performance of NBA players. Utilizing advanced statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, this project explores various factors that influence player performance. The repository contains datasets, code, and detailed documentation, providing insights into player performance trends and predictive modeling in basketball.

Methodologies:
Use mean and standard deviation to understand the general trends and characteristics of the players.
Apply correlation techniques to explore the relationship between individual player stats and their teams' win rates.
Use regression models to analyze how players' performance metrics evolve across their career spans.
Implement predictive models, like logistic regression, to forecast players' performance in playoff games based on regular season data.
Employ methods like PCA to identify the most influential variables affecting player performance.


Tools Used:
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciKit Learn)
Jupyter Notebooks
Data from Kaggle Dataset. [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data]

Objective:
To offer data-driven insights and predictive models that help understand and forecast NBA player performance, enhancing strategic decisions in team management and player assessment.

Questions:
How do individual player statistics (such as points per game, assists, and rebounds) compare to other playes?
What is the relationship between a player's experience (number of seasons played) and performance metrics over time?
Can machine learning models using player stats from the regular season accurately predict playoff performance and outcomes?
